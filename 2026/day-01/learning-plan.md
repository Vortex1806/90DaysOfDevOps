# 90 Days DevOps Learning Plan

Name: Shubh N Vora
Current Level: Working Professional (SDET / Automation Engineer)

1. My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering

DevOps is not just tools like Docker or Kubernetes. It is a culture of collaboration between development and operations to deliver software faster, reliably, and with high availability. It focuses on automation, monitoring, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and ownership of systems in production.

Cloud Engineering is about designing, deploying, and managing scalable, secure, and fault-tolerant infrastructure on platforms like AWS. It involves understanding networking, compute, storage, monitoring, and cost optimization at production scale.

DevOps + Cloud together mean:
Building, automating, deploying, and maintaining production systems efficiently and reliably.

2. Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud

I currently work as an Automation Engineer. I enjoy solving real-world problems and understanding how systems work internally. However, I want to move beyond writing automation scripts.

I want to:

Understand how applications run in production
Handle real-time incidents and scaling issues
Build and manage scalable systems
Transition from Automation Engineer → SRE → DevOps Engineer
This is not just skill learning. This is a career upgrade.

3. Where I Want to Reach

In the next 90 days, I want to:

Deploy a production-grade application on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes.
Build and implement a complete CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions/Jenkins).
Crack interviews for a DevOps / Cloud Engineer role in a top product-based or MAANG-level company.
Long-term goal: Become a high-impact DevOps/SRE engineer who can design and manage production infrastructure confidently.

4. 3 Core Skills I Will Build

Linux & Networking Fundamentals (debugging, processes, logs, permissions)
CI/CD & Automation (Git, Jenkins/GitHub Actions, pipelines)
Cloud & Kubernetes (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring)

5. Weekly Time Commitment

Weekdays: 2–3 hours daily after work
Weekends: Live classes + 4–6 focused hours
Total: ~18–22 hours per week
No zero days.

6. How I Will Stay Consistent

Attend all weekend live classes without fail.
Study minimum 2 hours daily regardless of workload.
Practice hands-on labs instead of passive watching.
Track daily progress in a public GitHub repository.
Post weekly updates to stay accountable.
Discipline over motivation. Execution over excuses.
